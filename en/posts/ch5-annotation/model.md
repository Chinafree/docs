### 5.1 Model class write

Examples with Chapter IV, we are here to extract a github project name, author, and three profile information, so we define a Model class.

```java
public class GithubRepo {

    private String name;

    private String author;

    private String readme;

}
```

Here are omitted getter and setter methods.

In extracting the end, we will get one or more instances of this class, this is the result of reptiles.
